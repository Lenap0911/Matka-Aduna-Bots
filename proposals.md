## Track 1: Prediction and Forecasting Methodology

**Title: Ensemble Modeling with Cyclical Pattern Recognition**

Our GDP forecasting combines linear, polynomial, and moving average models into an ensemble prediction. We analyze 100-year historical data to identify farming and fishing cycles (7-year and 3-year patterns respectively). By calculating income changes during good/bad transitions and incorporating profession-specific earnings data, we adjust predictions based on expected weather patterns. The ensemble approach reduces individual model bias while capturing both long-term trends and cyclical variations for years 101-105.

## Track 2: Social Science

**Title: Beyond GDP: Profession Diversity and Economic Resilience**

While GDP growth measures success, our analysis revealed profession distribution drives stability. Initial assumptions about continuous fishing income growth proved wrong—we discovered 3-year cycles. Farming shows complex 7-year patterns with income varying by one standard deviation from the mean. Cross-team collaboration on weather forecasting was essential. Despite GDP focus, we prioritize employment rates and profession diversity, recognizing that balanced livelihoods create more resilient communities than pure economic output.

## Track 3: Anything Else

**Title: The Island of Data-Driven Decisions**

Matka Aduna Bots thrives on curiosity and collaboration. From discovering farming cycles in weather data to building income predictors for each profession, every insight strengthened our island. We found our rhythm working between buildings, sharing screens and ideas. Our anthem: "From sea to field, with data we yield, prosperity through patterns revealed!" Our greatest pride? Not just predictions, but understanding our citizens' lives through numbers that tell human stories.
